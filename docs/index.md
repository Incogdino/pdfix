PDFix is a CLI application used to modify and create PDF files locally on your computer. It is **lightweight**, **fast** and can **work offline**. Most importantly, it is safe (no need to connect to the internet for it to work) and open source.

PDFix main features include:

1. Merging two (or more) pdf files together.
2. Removing specified pages from a pdf file.

More features are planned in the planned enhancement section.

## Why PDFix?

Conventionally, manipulating pdf files have known to be cumbersome and expensive. Many solutions require paid subscriptions or rely on online services that pose significant security risks. Furthermore, uploading sensitive documents to the web also poses a risk to your assets.

PDFix is different in a way that:

1. **Security First**: Unlike online tools, PDFix processes your files entirely offline, ensuring that your sensitive documents never leaves your computer or gets uploaded onto the internet. This eliminates the risk of exposure to data breaches or malicious websites.

2. **Cost-Effective**: PDFix is completely free and open-source, making PDF manipulation accessible to everyone.

3. **Simplicity and Speed**: Designed to be lightweight and intuitive, PDFix delivers fast performance without compromising on functionality. Whether merging multiple PDFs or removing pages, the process is straightforward and efficient.

4. **Full Control**: With PDFix, youâ€™re in complete control of your files and workflow. No uploads, no waiting, no third-party interference.

PDFix safeguards your documents and empower you with a reliable and trustworthy tool for all your PDF needs.
